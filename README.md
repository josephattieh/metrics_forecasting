# Metrics Forecasting

This project was submitted to the Network Analytics course at KTH. 

With the help of the newest advances in machine learning, researchers were able to build models that can
predict system performance metrics from a set of measurements collected from the system. In this project,
we are presented with data traces collected from a Video-on-Demand service deployed in an experimental
setup at KTH. We are asked to train regression models that use these infrastructure measurements
to predict the service-level metric, which in our case is the Video Frame Rate. The rest of the report is
structured in three main parts: The first part introduces the reader to the machine learning concepts used
in this project. The second part corresponds to the data description. The rest of the parts match the tasks
in the project description.
